      <img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Katherine Cuellar">

      <p>I’m a Texas native from San Antonio with a deep love for the Spurs, Whataburger, and authentic Tex-Mex. </p>

      <p>After graduating with a Sound Design degree from SCAD in 2015, I moved to Atlanta to pursue a career in audio engineering for film and television. While working as a freelance editor, I began exploring my long-standing interest in coding.</p>

      <p>When I learned all I could on my own, I decided a classroom was the place I wanted to be. I’m currently a student in Georgia Tech’s Coding Bootcamp, staying serious about programming and working hard to learn as much as I can to become a developer. </p>
